2. Calculate the average transaction amount for all purchases made at D-Mart on January 15, 2025.

RESPONSE:
To calculate the average transaction amount for all purchases made at D-Mart on January 15, 2025, you would need to filter the transactions based on the following criteria:

1. The `date` should be January 15, 2025.

10. Compute the variance in transaction amounts for the purchases on January 15, 2025, at D-Mart.

RESPONSE:
To compute the variance in transaction amounts for purchases on January 15, 2025, at D-Mart, you would need to follow these steps:

1. **Filter the Data**: Extract all transactions that occurred on January 15, 2025, where the merchant is D-Mart.

2. **Extract Amounts**: From the filtered data, extract the transaction amounts.

3. **Calculate the Mean**: Compute the mean (average) of these transaction amounts.

4. **Compute Variance**: Use the formula for variance, which is the average of the squared differences from the mean.

   \[
   \text{Variance} = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}
   \]

   Where \( x_i \) represents each transaction amount, \( \bar{x} \) is the mean of the transaction amounts, and \( n \) is the number of transactions.

Since I don't have access to the actual data, I can't perform these calculations directly. However, if you have the data, you can apply these steps using a tool like Excel, Python (with pandas), or any statistical software to find the variance.

13. Generate a histogram of transaction amounts for the purchases made at D-Mart on January 15, 2025.

RESPONSE:
To generate a histogram of transaction amounts for purchases made at D-Mart on January 15, 2025, you would need to follow these steps using the provided CSV data:

1. **Filter the Data**: Extract transactions where the `merchant` is "D-Mart" and the `date` is "January 15, 2025".

2. **Extract Amounts**: From the filtered data, extract the `amount` column which contains the transaction amounts.

3. **Plot the Histogram**: Use a plotting library like Matplotlib in Python to create a histogram of these amounts.

Here is a sample code snippet in Python using Pandas and Matplotlib:

```python

# Load the CSV data into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Filter transactions for D-Mart on January 15, 2025
filtered_data = df[(df['merchant'] == 'D-Mart') & (df['date'] == '2025-01-15')]

# Extract the transaction amounts
amounts = filtered_data['amount']

# Plot the histogram
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(amounts, bins=10, color='blue', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Histogram of Transaction Amounts at D-Mart on January 15, 2025')
plt.xlabel('Transaction Amount')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This code will generate a histogram showing the distribution of transaction amounts for purchases made at D-Mart on the specified date. Adjust the number of bins or other parameters as needed to better visualize the data.

19. What is the proportion of grocery transactions to the total transactions at D-Mart on January 15, 2025?

RESPONSE:
To determine the proportion of grocery transactions to the total transactions at D-Mart on January 15, 2025, you would need to filter the data for transactions that occurred on that specific date and at that specific merchant. Then, within those transactions, count how many fall under the "grocery" category. Finally, divide the number of grocery transactions by the total number of transactions at D-Mart on that date to get the proportion.

However, without the actual data from the CSV file, I cannot calculate this proportion. You would need to perform these steps using a data analysis tool or software that can process CSV files, such as Excel, Python (with pandas), or R.

1. **Filter Transactions**: Extract all transactions where the merchant is "D-Mart".

2. **Select Date**: Further filter these transactions to only include those on the specified date.

3. **Calculate IQR**:
   - Sort the transaction amounts.
   - Calculate the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of the transaction amounts.
   - Compute the IQR as \( \text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1 \).

4. **Determine Outliers**:
   - Calculate the lower bound as \( \text{Lower Bound} = Q1 - 1.5 \times \text{IQR} \).
   - Calculate the upper bound as \( \text{Upper Bound} = Q3 + 1.5 \times \text{IQR} \).
   - Identify any transaction amounts below the lower bound or above the upper bound as outliers.

Since I don't have the actual transaction data, I can't perform these calculations directly. However, you can apply this method to your dataset to find the outliers.
